# Real-Time-Object-Detection

The first and foremost thing is python should be installed on your computer. The project is completely coded with python as base language.
If it is not installed you can easily install it by yourself.


	WINDOWS
If you are a Windows user you can directly download the python installer form their official website.
Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

	LINUX
If you are a Linux user you can directly install the python from command line.
sudo apt install python3
Note: command lines will be different for different distros

We need to install some packages to make the code work
•	NumPy
-	NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

•	OpenCV
-	OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV-Python makes use of Numpy, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy such as SciPy and Matplotlib.

As soon as we run the code we can see the output a window will pop up with our webcam and it detects some objects. Here are some sample images of the output

In my repository the yolo version 4 weights file is not there you can directly download from their official page

Have fun with Computer Vision : )
